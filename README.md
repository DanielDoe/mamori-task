## **Introduction**

Mamori is an advanced platform for smart contract auditing, focused on identifying and mitigating economic risks within DeFi platforms. This repository contains research projects that showcase various approaches and techniques used in Mamori to ensure the security, reliability, and economic soundness of smart contracts.

## **Projects Overview**

### 1. Convex Flow Problem Integration

This project explores the integration of convex flow problem-solving techniques into Mamoriâ€™s auditing framework. The convex flow approach is used to optimize the allocation of auditing resources and improve the detection of potential economic exploits within smart contracts.

- **Key Features**:
  - Optimizing audit processes using convex flow dual decomposition.
  - Parallel and scalable auditing of large smart contracts.
  - Visualization of exploit pathways within smart contracts.

### 2. Open Source Libraries for Redundant Calculation Elimination

This project evaluates different open-source libraries aimed at reducing computation time by embedding formal verification techniques into algorithmic solutions. It provides insights into the performance, flexibility, and limitations of libraries such as Z3, SymPy, CBMC, and PySMT.

- **Key Features**:
  - Evaluation of formal verification tools.
  - Strategies for reducing redundant calculations in smart contracts.
  - Integration insights and performance optimization.

### 3. Deployment of a Simple Atomic MEV Arbitrage Contract

This project demonstrates the deployment of a simple atomic MEV (Miner Extractable Value) arbitrage contract on the Sepolia testnet. The project follows guidelines from the Flashbots GitHub repository and provides a verifiable transaction to demonstrate the deployment and functionality.

- **Key Features**:
  - Step-by-step guide for deploying an MEV arbitrage contract.
  - Interaction with the Sepolia testnet.
  - Verification of deployed contracts on Etherscan.

### 4. Advanced Smart Contract Auditing Techniques

This project encompasses various techniques used in Mamori to enhance smart contract auditing. It includes formal verification, symbolic execution, and heuristic optimization approaches, all aimed at ensuring the security and economic robustness of smart contracts.

- **Key Features**:
  - Formal verification and symbolic execution techniques.
  - Heuristic optimization for detecting economic exploits.
  - Scalability and parallelization strategies.
