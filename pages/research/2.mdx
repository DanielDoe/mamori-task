# **Subject:** Challenges in Detecting Arbitrages on August 21, 2024

Detecting arbitrage opportunities, particularly in the context of Miner Extractable Value (MEV), poses several challenges due to the dynamic and complex nature of decentralized finance (DeFi) markets. Our team has analyzed these challenges and provided specific examples to illustrate their impact on arbitrage detection and execution.

## **1. Latency and Speed of Execution**

- **Market Volatility:** DeFi markets can experience rapid price fluctuations, which makes it difficult to identify arbitrage opportunities before they disappear. The window of opportunity for arbitrage is often extremely short, requiring detection and execution to occur in milliseconds.
- **Network Congestion:** Blockchain networks, especially during peak times, can experience congestion, leading to delays in transaction confirmation. This latency can render detected arbitrage opportunities obsolete by the time they are executed.
- **Competition:** Many participants in the DeFi space deploy bots to scan for arbitrage opportunities. This creates a highly competitive environment where multiple parties race to exploit the same opportunity, often leading to increased transaction fees (gas wars) and a narrowing of profit margins.

**Example:** In the arbitrage transaction we analyzed, the opportunity was likely detected due to a small price discrepancy between PRX, WBNB, and USDT across different liquidity pools or exchanges. However, if the network was congested at the time of the transaction, or if another arbitrageur had detected the opportunity slightly earlier, the arbitrageur might have missed the window to execute the trade at the desired prices. This delay could lead to a loss or significantly reduced profit, as prices could have equalized by the time the transaction was confirmed.

## **2. Transaction Costs**

- **Gas Fees:** High gas fees on blockchains like Ethereum can significantly eat into potential arbitrage profits. The cost of executing multiple transactions (e.g., swapping tokens, transferring funds) must be lower than the arbitrage profit to make the effort worthwhile. This necessitates complex calculations in real-time to ensure profitability after accounting for fees.
- **Slippage:** Price slippage, which occurs when the execution price of a transaction differs from the quoted price due to market movement, can also impact profitability. Detecting and mitigating slippage requires sophisticated algorithms that can predict market movements.

**Example:** The cost of executing this arbitrage transaction was \$0.153898. If the gas fees on the network had spiked due to network congestion or a sudden surge in transaction volume, the cost could have eaten into the arbitrageur's profit of \$8.623506. For instance, if gas fees had doubled, the profit margin would have been significantly reduced, potentially making the arbitrage opportunity unprofitable.

## **3. Liquidity Constraints**

- **Low Liquidity Pools:** Arbitrage opportunities are more challenging to detect and exploit in low liquidity pools where large trades can significantly impact the price. The impact of a transaction on the market price (market impact) needs to be carefully considered to avoid diminishing returns.
- **Fragmented Liquidity:** DeFi ecosystems often have fragmented liquidity across different platforms and exchanges. Detecting arbitrage requires monitoring multiple platforms simultaneously, which increases the complexity of the detection process.

**Example:** If the liquidity in the PRX-WBNB or WBNB-USDT pools was low, the arbitrageur might have faced significant slippage when executing the trades, causing the actual prices to deviate from the expected prices. For example, selling a large amount of PRX in a low-liquidity pool could push the price down, reducing the amount of WBNB received. This slippage could have reduced the final profit or even led to a loss if the price impact was severe enough.

## **4. Smart Contract Complexity**

- **Contract Interactions:** Arbitrage in DeFi often involves interacting with multiple smart contracts across different platforms. The complexity of these interactions, including potential bugs or vulnerabilities in the smart contracts, adds risk and can complicate the detection process.
- **Front-running Risks:** MEV strategies like front-running, where an attacker inserts their transaction ahead of others to capture value, can undermine arbitrage opportunities. Detecting and defending against front-running requires advanced techniques such as the use of private transactions or flashbots.

**Example:** The arbitrage transaction involved interacting with multiple smart contracts to swap PRX for WBNB and then WBNB for USDT. If any of these smart contracts had vulnerabilities or bugs, the arbitrageur could have lost funds. For instance, a bug in the smart contract could have led to an incorrect calculation of the token amounts, resulting in an unfavorable exchange rate and thus reducing the profit or causing a loss.

## **5. Data Fragmentation and Real-Time Analytics**

- **Real-Time Data Requirements:** Detecting arbitrage opportunities requires access to real-time data from multiple sources. However, the decentralized nature of DeFi means that data can be fragmented across different blockchains and exchanges. Aggregating and analyzing this data in real-time poses significant technical challenges.
- **Inaccurate Data Feeds:** Relying on inaccurate or delayed price feeds can lead to missed opportunities or incorrect calculations, making it crucial to have reliable data sources and efficient data processing pipelines.

**Example:** Detecting the arbitrage opportunity required real-time data from multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs). If the price data from one exchange was delayed or inaccurate, the arbitrageur might have calculated an incorrect profit margin. For example, if the PRX price on one DEX was reported with a delay, the arbitrageur might have expected to sell PRX for more WBNB than was actually possible, leading to a lower-than-expected profit.

## **6. Security and Risk Management**

- **Smart Contract Risks:** Engaging in arbitrage often involves interacting with multiple smart contracts, each with its own set of risks. Smart contract bugs, vulnerabilities, or exploits can result in loss of funds. Detecting safe arbitrage opportunities requires thorough contract analysis, which is challenging in fast-paced environments.
- **Regulatory Risks:** The regulatory landscape for DeFi and MEV is still evolving. Arbitrage opportunities that exploit regulatory loopholes or operate in legally ambiguous areas could expose participants to legal risks. Detecting and engaging in arbitrage must account for the ever-changing regulatory environment.

**Example:** While executing this arbitrage, the arbitrageur might have been exposed to risks such as front-running, where another participant observes the transaction in the mempool and inserts a higher gas fee to execute a similar trade first. If this had occurred, the arbitrageur could have found that the price discrepancy was eliminated before their transaction was confirmed, resulting in no profit or a loss.

## **7. Economic and Game-Theoretic Considerations**

- **Strategic Behavior by Other Actors:** MEV and arbitrage exist within a complex ecosystem where other participants, including validators and miners, might strategically behave to maximize their own profits. This can involve collusion, sandwich attacks, or other forms of manipulation, making it difficult to detect and execute pure arbitrage.
- **Dynamic Equilibria:** The actions of arbitrageurs can themselves influence market prices, leading to dynamic equilibria where the detection of an arbitrage opportunity by one participant can immediately lead to its dissolution as others act on it.

**Example:** The presence of other arbitrageurs monitoring the same markets could have created a race condition. If multiple arbitrageurs attempted to exploit the same price discrepancy simultaneously, they could have driven up transaction costs (through gas fee bidding wars) or reduced the price discrepancy too quickly. In this scenario, if another arbitrageur had acted just before the one analyzed, the profit margin could have diminished, making the opportunity less attractive.

## **8. Ethical and Fairness Considerations**

- **Fairness in MEV:** The ethics of extracting MEV, especially in ways that harm regular users (e.g., by worsening slippage or increasing fees), is a topic of ongoing debate. Detecting and participating in MEV-based arbitrage must balance profit-making with fairness and ethical considerations, which can limit the scope of opportunities.

**Example:** The arbitrageur's actions might have caused slippage or increased transaction costs for other users trading the same tokens. For instance, if the arbitrageur had purchased a large amount of WBNB, this could have increased the price of WBNB, adversely affecting other users trying to buy WBNB at that time. This raises ethical questions about the fairness of MEV extraction, particularly when it harms other participants in the market.

## **Conclusion**

Detecting arbitrage in the context of MEV is a multifaceted challenge that involves navigating technical, economic, and ethical complexities. The rapid pace of the DeFi ecosystem, coupled with the need for real-time data and execution, makes this a highly specialized field where only the most advanced algorithms and strategies can consistently succeed. Our research highlights the need for sophisticated detection mechanisms and risk management strategies to effectively capitalize on these opportunities while mitigating the associated risks.
