# **Subject:** Halmos for Mamori's Redundant Calculation Elimination

## **Introduction**

Halmos is a formal verification tool that leverages symbolic testing to explore and validate the behavior of software systems. It is particularly effective in identifying redundant calculations and optimizing computational processes by eliminating unnecessary paths in the execution flow. However, despite its strengths, Halmos may face challenges in terms of integration complexity, state explosion, and computational overhead when applied to large-scale systems such as Mamori’s smart contract auditing framework. This document provides specific strategies, including performance optimization techniques, cloud-based solutions, and other tools to mitigate these challenges.

## **Limitations of Halmos**
